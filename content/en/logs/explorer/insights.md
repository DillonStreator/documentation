## Overview

Datadog Log Explorer offers Watchdog Insights to highlight signals that stand out within your search context based on the time frame and tags.

In the Log Explorer, Watchdog Insights surface logs based on patterns and specific tags that have been flagged by algorithms such as log anomaly detection and error outliers detection.

### Log Anomaly Detection

Ingested logs are analyzed at the intake level where Watchdog performs aggregations on detected patterns as well as `environment`, `service`,`source` and `status`tags.
These aggregated logs are scanned for anomalous behaviors, such as the following:
- An emergence of logs with a warning or error status.
* A sudden increase of logs with a warning or error status.


The logs surface as Insights in the Log Explorer, matching the search context and any restrictions applied to your role.
